This repository is intended to show the progress and examples of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) ontology

The LCAOntology.ttl is the current version of the ontology.  It imports the follwing ontologies:
- the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)
- the Industrial Ontologies Foundry (IOF)
- the IOF Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing Ontologies, namely Equipment, Manufacturing Execution, Material, Monitoring & Control, Parameter, Physical and Recipe ontologies.

With these imports, the LCA Ontology utilizes the Recipes and Manufacturing Execution Ontologies, along with Material, to descibe biological methods for producing Acetic Acid with Bacteria.
The included examples show two bacterial methods from a General Recipe through a Control Recipe.  One of the examples is further extended to the Manufacturing Execution.

These files and this README will be updated as extensions to the ontology and the examples are performed.
